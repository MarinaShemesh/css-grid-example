            <p>There are many different types of cactus plants, including some that grow in trees! However, most people grow theirs either outdoors in the landscape or indoors as houseplants. Always read the plant tags for specific details, but for the most part, cacti thrive in full sun and fast-draining soil. Indoors, this means growing near a south- or west-facing window.</p>
